- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @maciejslezak
- I've created this repository to begin my coding journey.
- I want to improve my skills and explore the following topics:
  - Embedded/IoT systems programming (mainly C language),
  - FPGA/ASIC, digital hardware design and verification (Verilog, SystemVerilog),
  - Private computer networks (I want to develop home server in the future, mainly Python language),
  - And I hope there will be more interesting topics here in the future...

- This repository is created for educational purposes, so its content might not be perfect. However, if You somehow got lost in the depths of repositories, reached my place here and found any code sample useful - feel free to use it :)
